## Project Overview

Doogle is my final solo project for Mod3 at The Turing School of Software and Design Front End program. The original project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html).

This application is a play on the very popular dating website called Tinder. However, instead of matching with humans, users are matching with Golden Retrievers. On the landing page, users will see a 'dog card' with an image of a golden retriever, a red 'x' and a green 'heart' appear. If the user would like to match with a dog, they can click the green heart on the bottom right hand corner of the card and a new dog image will render. The match will be added to the user match list. If the user does not want to match with the dog, they can click the red 'x' and a new dog image will appear. If the user would like to view their matches, they can click 'Your Matches' on the nav bar where all dog cards that were matched will display. If the user would like to delete a match, they can click on the 'delete button'.
